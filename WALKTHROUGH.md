# Login Redesign & Advanced Auth Walkthrough

The login experience has been completely transformed with a high-end, two-column dark aesthetic and the addition of Phone Number authentication.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. 🎨 Premium Redesign
- **Two-Column Layout**: A responsive side-by-side design featuring a primary form area on the left and an immersive promotional card with a testimonial on the right.
- **Dark Aesthetic**: Switched to a deep charcoal (`#09090b`) background with glassmorphism effects and the vibrant `#F4511C` brand accent.
- **Micro-interactions**: Added smooth entrance animations and hover states for all interactive elements.

### 2. 📱 Phone Authentication
- **Multi-Method Auth**: Users can now choose between **Email**, **Phone**, or **Google** login via a sleek tab switcher.
- **OTP Verification**: Integrated Firebase Phone Auth with an invisible Recaptcha and a 6-digit OTP verification step.
- **Auto-Sync**: Like other methods, phone-verified users are automatically synced with their Firestore profile documents.

### 3. 🔐 Security & UX
- **Invisible Recaptcha**: Security is handled silently in the background without interrupting the user flow.
- **Protected Routing**: The application remains fully secured, redirecting any unauthenticated access back to the new login experience.

## Verification Progress
- [x] **Build Integrity**: ✅ PASS (Production bundle successfully generated)
- [x] **Auth Context**: ✅ VERIFIED (Phone auth methods correctly integrated into `AuthContext`)
- [x] **UI Layout**: ✅ VERIFIED (Responsive two-column grid confirmed)

## Next Steps
- **Firebase Console**: Ensure **Phone** is enabled as a sign-in provider and that your authorized domains include the production URL for Recaptcha to work seamlessly in production.
