## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Client Deployment (Do This First)
```bash
# 1. From repo root
cd /workspaces/MVP
git add .
git commit -m "Vercel deployment setup"
git push origin main

# 2. Go to https://vercel.com/new
# 3. Import GitHub repository
# 4. Set name: "mvp-client"
# 5. Set Root Directory: client
# 6. Click Deploy
```

### Server Deployment (Do This Second)
```bash
# On vercel.com
# 1. Click New Project
# 2. Import same GitHub repository
# 3. Set name: "mvp-server"
# 4. Set Root Directory: server

## 🔧 Post-Deployment

### Update Client to Use Deployed Server
In client Vercel dashboard:
- Go to Settings > Environment Variables
- Add: `VITE_API_URL=https://mvp-server-xxx.vercel.app`
- Re-deploy

### Test Endpoints
```bash
# Test server health
curl https://mvp-server-xxx.vercel.app/api/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2026-03-25T..."}
```

## ❌ If You Get 404 Error

### Issue 1: Client 404
- [ ] Check `/client/dist/index.html` exists locally
- [ ] Run `npm run build` in client to verify
- [ ] Check Vercel logs for build errors
- [ ] Verify `vercel.json` outputDirectory is `dist`

### Issue 2: Server 404
- [ ] Check server listens on correct port
- [ ] Verify `vercel.json` routes are correct
- [ ] Check Vercel logs for startup errors
- [ ] Ensure `src/index.js` exists and is valid

### Issue 3: Connection Issues
- [ ] Verify server URL in client environment variables
- [ ] Check CORS is enabled in server
- [ ] Check Database_URL is correct (server only)
